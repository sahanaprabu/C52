            <h2> Who am I??</h2>
            I am a student at Dublin Jerome High School. I play volleyball, and I like to cook. I live with my Mom, my Dad, and my Sister. My family and I like to travel a lot, we have been to Europe, Turkey, India, Mexico, and many other places around the world!!
            My favorite Disney movie is Lilo and Stitch, and I hate scary movies. I am also interested in fashion/style.
